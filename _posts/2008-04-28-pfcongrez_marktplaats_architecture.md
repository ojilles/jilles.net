On April 12th I presented at <a
href="http://www.pfcongrez.nl/2008/index.html">PFCongrez</a>, a yearly
gathering of PHPFreakz. During the day three other presentations were given.
The first one was by Peter-Paul Koch (ppk for short) who presented about <a
href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2008/04/slides_pfcongre.html">unobtrusive
javascript</a>. The presentation was given with a lot of energy, enjoyable!

After that, I presented a sneak peak at <a
href="http://www.marktplaats.nl">Marktplaats</a> during which I gave some
insight into what it takes to run one of the biggest sites of the Netherlands.
It goes into some of the high level production setup, highlights some of the
challenges of operating hundreds of database deployments and goes into some of
the aspects Marktplaats runs into while using PHP.

The slides are embedded below, or up for download here. Or join the after party <a href="http://www.phpfreakz.nl/forum.php?forum=5&iid=1125709">discussion</a>.

The other presentations during the day that can be found online:

* Peter Paul Koch, <a
  href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2008/04/slides_pfcongre.html">Unobstrusive
  Javascript</a>
* Stefan Koopmanschap, <a

Next to that, I am trying to gauge any interest in our tool to manage database
schema's: DBC. It keeps database schema's in synch with your application, and
allows developers to branch off the database schema much as a version control
system allows you to do with your code. If you are interested in this tool,
please contact me at "jilles &at& marktplaats . nl". We are looking to see if
there is enough interest to open source the tool.
