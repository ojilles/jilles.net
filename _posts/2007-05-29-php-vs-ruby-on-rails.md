Terry Chay over at "<a href="http://terrychay.com/blog/">The Woodwork</a>" has
a length but nicely <a
href="http://terrychay.com/blog/article/is-ruby-the-dog-and-php-the-dogfood.shtml">written
blog post about a PHP vs Ruby on Rails discussion</a>. If you're interested in
that kind of stuff, read the article: it has some juicy humor sprinkled into it
as well; it's a bit flame bait too...

Favourite quote (quoting another quote):

    First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.
     -Mahatma Ghandi

    OSCON 2005:

    Unless you're Ruby.
     -Danny O'Brien, On Evil

And:

    I can't speak for Alex, but what I'm saying is look at the top 100 websites on
    the internet: about 40% of them are written in PHP and 0% of them are written
    in Rails. (Yes, I can (and am) using this statistic to grind you Ruby fuckers
    into the dust.)
