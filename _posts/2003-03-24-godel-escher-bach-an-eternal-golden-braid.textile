I've got an edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465026567/104-8640111-8926352?v=glance&n=283155">_Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid_</a> (GEB) by Douglas Hofstadter, a gift from my parents. Two words about this book: *oh my!*. I'm currently also reading _A storm of swords_ by Martin but I don't think I'll be able to read in that book as long as I haven't finished <span class="caps">GEB</span>. I mean, if a book like this can make a 23 yr old person fond of Zero 7, Yonderboy and Norah Jones yearn to hear _Musical Offering_ by J.S. Bach. Damn.

Well, I'm only 50 pages into the book and it really gets my interest. I was especially surprised that Hofstadter was able to make the same strange loops one can find in Eschers drawings, Bachs music and Godels math in the dialogs between Achilles and Tortoise!

I don't get the clue of the last two paragraphs of the dialog between Achilles and Tortoise for the second chapter. The part of accepting rules A, B but not Z is not that hard to get but what I don't get is the "adopting pun"-part:
bq. 
<p class="MsoNormal">"And would you mind, as a personal favor, considering what a lot of instruction this colloquy of ours will provide for the Logicians of the Nineteenth Century would you mind adopting a pun that my cousin the Mock-Turtle will then make, and allowing yourself to be renamed <span class="caps">TAUGHT</span>

'As you please," replied the weary warrior, in the hollow tones of despair, as he buried his face in his hands."Provided that <span class="caps">YOU</span>, for <span class="caps">YOUR</span> part, will adopt a pun the Mock-Turtle never made, and allow yourself to be renamed a <span class="caps">KILL</span>-EASE!"
<p class="MsoNormal">(from G.E.B. by Hofstadter)



That is the part I don't get. Are they setting up for the same conversation this time about a comment the Mock-Turtle will make in the future, instead of two sides of a triangle? Someone comment, track-back or mail me please!
