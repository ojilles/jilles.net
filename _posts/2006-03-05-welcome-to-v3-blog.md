**Update, 2011: this is obviously an old blog post, preserved for posterity.**

Welcome, dear reader to, to the best of my knowledge, the third incarnation of
my weblog/personal site. The last year and a half I had all these idea's in my
head with nowhere to put them. Everytime I had that thought "_I wish I had a
weblog to post it to as it might be interesting to other people_". So, here it
is!

The source of my idea's is mostly twofold:

* It's triggered by things that I read. Weblogs, other sites, that inspire new
  thought and those thoughts should end up here.
* At work. My work is in the product development group of a large webbased
  company located in the Netherlands. There are various reasons why I love
  working there, one of them is that it always inspires ideas on the topics of
  software development, online communities, management and business
  development.

From past experience I know that it is really hard to really add value on the
web which is why I chose the default Kubrick's theme and a base install of
WordPress: lets see if I can get content into the site first, before spending
hours tweaking the site.

I hope you will enjoy the site!

PS1: Since this is really the 3rd incarnation of the site you will find the
first few articles already, all dated in 2003 and 2004.

PS2: I still had a Google AdSense account, so I added some advertising to the
site. If I can make up for hosting costs, then I will count myself lucky!
