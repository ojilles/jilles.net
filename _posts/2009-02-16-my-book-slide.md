Inspired by Jurgen from Noop.nl, here is my bookslide. I'll limit myself to the
books that I just got though. You can find <a
href="http://www.shelfari.com/ojilles/lists/IsRead#firstBook=0&list=5&sort=dateadded">my
virtual bookshelf over at Shelfari</a>. This round of books are a bit sciency
more so that others but that is predominantly the case due to George R R Martin
still not having <a
href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/if-update.html">finished his next book</a>.

*<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/54118/The-Island-at-the-Center-of-the-World-The-Epic-Story-of-Dutch-Ma">The Island at the Center of the World</a>*
"_An epic story of dutch Manhattan and the forgotten colony that shaped America_"

Inspired by a holiday I took last summer to New York and Miami I started
interesting myself for the dutch influence and history on the island of
Manhattan. Lots of facts have been pushed out of our collective memories
nowadays. I'm hoping this book will let me in on some of the more arcane facts
that surely must be out there.

*<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/36322/Surely-You-re-Joking-Mr-Feynman-(Adventures-of-a-Curious-Charact">Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman!</a>*
"_Adventures of a curious character_"

After <a href="http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8">watching a series of
guest lectures</a> and having general interest and admiration on the LHC in
Switzerland this seemed like a natural follow up. Feynman is both funny and
really smart and was actually able to teach me a few things through his
recorded lectures. Things like the LHC and books like <a
href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/45918/Godel-Escher-Bach-An-Eternal-Golden-Braid">Godel,
Escher, Bach</a>/<a
href="http://www.shelfari.com/booksearch.aspx?keywords=Song+of+Ice+and+Fire">Song
of Ice and Fire</a>/<a
href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/12276/The-Lord-of-the-Rings">Lord of the
Rings</a> really strike a personal cord with me as I admire the epic scales
these things take place at. Respect for those that dare to stick out their
necks and *create* something!

*<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/4045910/The-Unfinished-Game-Pascal-Fermat-and-the-Seventeenth-Century-Le">The Unfinished Game</a>*
"_Pascal, Fermat and the Seventeenth Century Letter that made the World Modern_"

A book on probability, a topic that recently found more and more interesting
(read <a
href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/21447/Critical-Mass-How-One-Thing-Leads-to-Another">Critical
Mass</a>, <a
href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/10015/The-Tipping-Point-How-Little-Things-Can-Make-a-Big-Difference">Tipping
Point</a> and <a
href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/370531/The-Black-Swan-The-Impact-of-the-Highly-Improbable">Black
Swans</a> couple of months ago). Especially the notion of "betting" on positive
outliers (writing a book) vs. negative ones (stock market crash) seems an
undervalued notion in our societies.

*<a href="http://www.shelfari.com/books/4057927/Outliers-The-Story-of-Success">Outliers</a>*
"_The story of success_"

Kind of the same reason why I included Outliers. Not sure what to expect
really, but written by Malcolm Gladwell I can not imagine it is going to be a
hard read.
