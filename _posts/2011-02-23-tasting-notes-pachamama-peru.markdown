This review is difficult to write. Difficult not only because I have to be harsh, but also because I feel like I've failed. I attempt to find a redeeming or commendable quality in just about every brew I try. 

I can't find anything to like about [Pachamama's Peruvian offering][1]. It's just bad coffee.

It lacks aroma. The mouthfeel is indistinguishable from tepid water. The acidity is off the chart. Its flavor is simple and singular; but unfortunately that flavor is dirt. I'm not exaggerating, it tastes like dirt. Or, more specifically, dirt-laden coffee bean skins (chaff).

My typical review process is to brew and drink several cups over a few days, making notes each time. When I sit down to write the review, I'll brew up another cup and go over my previous notes.

I'm sitting here drinking my third cup of this monstrosity and my opinion hasn't changed. The nuance that usually reveals itself after repeated tastings is completely absent. I hate this bean.

The things I do for you people.
