I watch and write a lot of presentations at work.  I also spend a reasonable
amount of time learning, and relearning from my own mistakes in crafting
presentations. This post attempts to collate these together to remind myself and
potentially share with others.

For this post I am assuming a presentation is chosen (for you). There are other
approaches, such as memo's that may be more suited.

### Premise
1. 80%+ of all failures in an organization larger than 1.000 people is
attributable to failed communication

2. Presentations, either as verb or noun, are a substantial part of
communications in a business

3. Thus improving your presentations will improve effectiveness of your
organization

### Rules
1. **No Builds**.
No presentation needs builds, animations or transitions; no exceptions. In
business this will invariably go wrong. Your audience will ask to go back a
slide or two, you end up half way in a build, or worse, with an empty slide.
None of this is needed. 

2. **Minimum font size 24pt**.
Yes, not all the words in your mind will fit on that one page. Yes, that
constraint will actually help you creating a clearer narrative. If it does not
fit, you are not done clarifying your concise messaging. 

3. **Use fewer words**.
Rule number 2 is trying to help you here. But for each iteration I set myself
the goal of removing half the words. This is hard, as I feel you need to leave
out important details and context. There is a place for details and context, but
neither are **the actual message you want to get across**.

4. **Stick with your organizations template**.
The challenge when you deviate from the default template is that it will become
cute, a time sink or a distraction for the reader. So stick with the default.
Don't like the default? Then create a new one as a separate activity. (You now
also crossed the chasm from author to designer, I hope you know what you are
doing.)

5. **Ensure your slide has a take-away**.
The slide presents thoughts, data, or whatever; too often the conclusion or the
action point of it is left to the reader or as voice over. Do not do this; spell
it out for your audience. They did not sign up for a Sherlock Holmes role-play.

6. **Executive Summary**.
Have one. No, have two: the slide after your title slide should be your
executive summary. Then run through your story line and bookend again with the
executive summary. This should be pixel for pixel the same content as the one in
the beginning. Your executive summary is not allowed to introduce anything new;
no new data, concepts or conclusions. [^6]

7. **Structure**.
Stories can be told in many different ways. One way that works well in most
situations is to divide the story arc up in Situation, Complication and
Solution. Leaving one of these three components out will seriously hamper your
ability to convince your audience, just like it is hard to ascend a staircase
with stairs missing. Yes, this is advice is coming from Professional Career
PowerPoint Wielders: take it [^1]. That link lays out the structure, and has
actual examples to get you going.

8. **Slide numbers**.
Each slide should have one. Not having one on random slides is telling me you
fumbled the slides together. It makes it hard for me to take notes, or to speed
up asking questions at the end. Do not do this to your audience. Cheap to fix.

9. **Data points**.
Chances are you have mentioned some piece of data somewhere. That is good. Not
all is lost. Just make sure that you make clear what the units are. Something
costs 1 million? Is that Euro's or Dollars? Almost no costs I encounter are
static, in other words they are likely better expressed as a rate of costs:
"This option will cost 1 million dollars per year, starting April 1st".
Secondly, if you have a lot riding on the data point (and why include it if you
do not?) then make sure attribute or source the data point. The more
  authoritative you can make this, the better. Keep in mind rule #16.

10. **Graphs**
I feel this requires its own article. In fact entire books [^2] have been written on
the topic. Instead, I will attempt to quickly run down the top points
* **All axis are labeled**. What do they represent, and include a unit
* **No Pie charts**. Invariably a time series chart will lead to better comparison
  of the data and will give the audience a sense of temporal change that Pie
  charts lack
* **Font sizes**. You are still creating a presentation, so rule #2 still
  applies
* **Context**. Showing a graph with error rates? Great! But do include the
  normal rates in the same graph for comparison

11. **Wall of text**
Do not every present a slide while starting off with "Well, I'm not going to
read all this out to you, but...". You have lost half the audience because they
are reading your wall of text. You lost the other half because you are being
disrespectful to them. So simply do not include any wall of text. Rule #2 is
here to help you with that.

12. **Homework** 
Linked to #11: at times I see people include slides like this to make the point
that they did a lot of homework in this area. If you are that person, ask
yourself why the audience would assume you did not do your homework. You are
likely operating under baseless assumptions.

13. **Artifacts**
Some people insist on sending the slides ahead of time. I think that depends on
the situation. However, I insist on sending the slides after the fact. Do not
waste time by forcing your audience to ask for it, take half correct notes or
worse interrupt your presentation over Zoom with a photo camera sound as they are
taking screenshots. Send the deck to them afterwards, thanking them for their
time.

14. **Typography**
Grok the basics of typography. Think of this as a set of battle tested
heuristics that do not require you to understand but just apply. I have found
that [Practical
Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html) is a
fantastic resource for this. A couple of quick relevant ones are:
 * Do not use bold and italics together. 
 * Do not underline at all.
 * Consider font size, line spacing, line length at first
 * The question mark is underused, the exclamation point overused [^3]
 * Treat headings as the structure of your argument, not your document

15. **Titles**
Titles for the individual slides or graphs should be the conclusion. Not only
will this save your audience from expanding the mental energy, it allows you to
select the conclusion you need if there is more than one available.  So instead
of "tire wear vs miles driven" it should say "tire wear increases with miles
driven" [^4].

16. **No numbers until you are done talking**
As soon as you put up a set of numbers or a graph the audience will
think, analyse and stop paying attention. That is your best case scenario. Worst
case, someone will interrupt you with a question that potentially disrupts the
flow. So only show these after you are done presenting your main point [^5]. 

Thank you for making it this far. If you did, you almost certainly thought of
something not covered here. Please leave a comment below or send me a [pull
request](https://github.com/ojilles/jilles.net/blob/master/_posts/2020-06-05-presentation-rules.md)!

Update 2020-06-06: The above got a [small amount of attention on
HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23434611), with
some great feedback in the comments. Thanks to everyone for contributing.

### Footnotes
[^1]: I believe the structure was first created, or popularized by McKinsey, who depending on your views, have a core business of turning slides into billion dollar revenue streams. [This link does a good introduction of the concepts](https://speakingsherpa.com/how-to-tell-a-business-story-using-the-mckinsey-situation-complication-resolution-scr-framework/), takes you step by step and references actual presentations as examples.
[^2]: The de facto standard work in this space is [Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)
[^3]: This felt as a surprising revelation once I started paying attention to it. See [here for more info](https://practicaltypography.com/question-marks-and-exclamation-points.html)
[^4]: As per [loghlane on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23435578): "So instead of “tire wear vs miles driven” it should say “tire wear increases with miles driven”"
[^5]: Thanks to [Triggercut](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23436348) on HN for bringing forward this feedback.
[^6]: The advice I gave in rule #6 is a more specific form of "Tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them", as [nicely demonstrated by example by grawprog on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23435371).
