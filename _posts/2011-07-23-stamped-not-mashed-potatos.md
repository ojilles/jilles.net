The other day I made a delicious potato dish, and having my camera ready, I
thought I'd share it with you! To go short, rather than baking potato disks, or
mashing them up completely, this dish nicely holds the middle. This produces a
really nice cruchy dish!

Ingredients:

* Potatos (have them decently sized)
* Salt, pepper
* Herbs (Rosemary, or ...)
* Oil

For starters, boil the potatos _in their skins_. That's important: in their
skins. This is what's going to make them so crunchy and good. You should add
some salt to taste. The best way to do that is to wait for the water to boil,
then add the salt. This works better as the water immediately dissolves it.
Start the oven or broiler. I put mine on 200-220 degrees C. Oil up a baking
plate. Once done, take out the boiled potatos, put them on the plate and crunch
them with your potato stamper, like so:

![Die you potato, die!][ph2]

Stamp them till they're maybe 1 to 2 cm in height, not more. Make sure they're
jagged on top. Here, another example:

After you've done the lot, sprinkle some oil on top:

And add more salt on top of the potatos, and your herbs. In the pictures you'll
see me experimenting with red onions: you're advised to skip that as it doesn't
work very well in the broiler.

After all this torture, the potatos still have one last step: the oven. I
usually put my oven on "broil" at around 200-220 degrees. Since the potatos are
already "done" (through the boiling) it all really doesn't matter too much.
What you are looking for is to harden up the outsides, the jagged tops, the
skins of the potatos. This will make it really crunchy, while the inside is
still nicely soft like a boiled potato.

Just check the oven every few minutes till you're happy with the result. Here was mine:

See all those brown bits?! Those are the best! Buon appetit!
